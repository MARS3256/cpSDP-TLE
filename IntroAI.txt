Some AI Systems that are Better Than Humans (1)
Checkers
Chinook was the first computer program to win a checkers world championship (using heuristics)
http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/
Checkers is now solved
http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/publications/solving_checkers.html
There is a proof that nothing can now beat this program (no more heuristics)

Some Failures of AI
The game GO
Simple rules but very large search space…
Expert systems (in general)
These attempted to encode an experts knowledge into an autonomous reasoning systems
Robotics in unstructured environments. A robot cannot
Clean my house
Cook when I don’t want to
Wash my clothes
Cut my grass
Fix my car (or take it to be fixed)
i.e. do the things that I don’t feel like doing…

Robotics
Robotics is AI in the physical world
It is the hardest subfield of AI because robots must sense and act in the physical world

The computer revolution has changed the world….

However, the robotics revolution, when it happens, will make the computer revolution pale in comparison

A Open Problem in AI/Robotics?
“Vision-based autonomous navigation in unstructured outdoor environments”

The problem of navigating between 2 GPS waypoints (more than a few hundred metres apart) in unstructured outdoor environments is unsolved!

 What About the DARPA Grand Challenge 2005?
Autonomous Navigation in the Desert over a 132 mile course.
5 Teams succeeded!
http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/gcorg/index.html
This was a monumental achievement in autonomous robotics
HOWEVER: This was not an unstructured environment!
GPS waypoints were carefully chosen, sometimes less than a meter apart.

What is AI?
Views of AI fall into four categories:
	Thinking humanly	Thinking rationally 
	Acting humanly	Acting rationally 

Warning, I advocate for “acting rationally” based on Machine Learning 
but I am willing to hear other arguments and change my mind

*
16
Introduction to AI

Acting humanly: Turing Test
Turing (1950) "Computing machinery and intelligence":
"Can machines think?" 🡪 "Can machines behave intelligently?"
Operational test for intelligent behavior: the Imitation Game





Predicted that by 2000, a machine might have a 30% chance of fooling a lay person for 5 minutes
Anticipated all major arguments against AI in following 50 years
Suggested major components of AI: knowledge, reasoning, language understanding, learning
*
17
Introduction to AI

Thinking humanly: cognitive modeling
1960s "cognitive revolution": information-processing psychology 

Requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain
How to validate? Requires 
    1) Predicting and testing behavior of human subjects (top-down), or 
    2) Direct identification from neurological data (bottom-up)
Both approaches (roughly, Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience)  are now distinct from AI
*
18
Introduction to AI

Thinking rationally: "laws of thought"
Aristotle: what are correct arguments/thought processes?

Several Greek schools developed various forms of logic: notation and rules of derivation for thoughts; may or may not have proceeded to the idea of mechanization

Direct line through mathematics and philosophy to modern AI

Problems: 
Not all intelligent behavior is mediated by logical deliberation
What is the purpose of thinking? What thoughts should I have?Should thinking need to be associated with actions?
*
19
Introduction to AI

Acting rationally: rational agent
Rational behavior: doing the right thing

The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement, given the available information
Problem: How do we know the agent is doing this?

Doesn't necessarily involve thinking – e.g., blinking reflex – but  thinking should be in the service of rational action
*
20
Introduction to AI

Rational agents
An agent is an entity that perceives and acts

This course is about designing rational agents

Abstractly, an agent is a function from percept histories to actions:
[f: P* 🡪 A]
For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the agent (or class of agents) with the best performance

Caveats:
computational limitations make perfect rationality unachievable
design best program for given machine resource
Can we ever know if an agent is acting rationally?

Personal View of AI by Greg Grudic
I want to build a robot that will
Clean my house
Cook when I don’t want to
Wash my clothes
Cut my grass
Fix my car (or take it to be fixed)
i.e. do the things that I don’t feel like doing…
Therefore: AI is (to me) the science of building machines (agents) that act rationally with respect to a goal.

What is a Rational Agent?
An agent is an entity that senses, computes and acts in some world
A rational agent is one that does the right thing
The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement (accomplishing tasks that Greg doesn’t feel like doing), given the available information
This is not a new idea: 
Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics): Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good

Why Must Representation and Reasoning be Encompassed by Learning?
Fundamental lesson of AI (learned in the 1980’s):
It is not possible to hand code knowledge about anything but the most trivial problem domains!
Uncertainty is a key problem!
Expert Systems: largely failed because an expert (e.g. doctor) doesn’t know how to formalize (code) what makes her an expert!
For Example: I’m an expert on chairs but I can’t (and no one can!) write a program that identifies chairs in an image
However, using ML techniques we are closer to this goal!
How can I reason rationally about a world I cannot encode knowledge about?
I do not believe that an agent can gain knowledge about a world without sampling it and learning from those samples….

Another Definition of Machine Learning
Machine Learning algorithms discover the relationships between the variables of a system (input, output and hidden) from direct samples of the system

These algorithms originate form many fields:
Statistics, mathematics, theoretical computer science, physics, neuroscience, etc

*
Introduction to AI
37
When are ML algorithms NOT needed?
When the relationships between all relevant system variables (input, output, and hidden) is adequately understood!

This is NOT the case for many complex real systems!

Search
AI can be thought of as
Specification of a GOAL
Optimization criteria…
Method for searching action and sensor space to achieve the goal
Two types of searches
Symbolic (logic, reasoning, etc)
Numeric – establish a continuous search space (topology)
Search in the real world is hard….
Efficient solutions require constraints in search space
Machine Learning is one framework for efficiently constraining search…

*

Planning
Start with an assumed structure in the problem space
e.g. robot in a Cartesian World (3-D map) wants to get to a GPS goal position from some start GPS position
Structure is used to plan a sequence of actions from some initial state to a goal state.

Optimal Decision Theory
Acting under uncertainty
Measuring uncertainty in complex environments is the domain of Machine Learning
Given all the available information, what is the optimal decision (or action) that the agent should take?

*
Introduction to AI

Computer Vision
The camera is our best sensor for physical human environments…
Humans are extremely good at interpreting the world visually
AI systems that work in the human physical world need  to utilize visual data
Computer vision uses realistic constraints and knowledge of camera geometry to infer knowledge about the world from 2D images

*
Introduction to AI
45
Robotics
Robotics is AI in the physical world
It is the hardest subfield of AI because robots must sense and act in the (uncertain) physical world
AI inside a computer (internet) is much more constrained
The computer revolution has changed the world….
However, the robotics revolution, when it happens, will make the computer revolution pale in comparison

The main challenge in robotics:
Visual perception
Visual perception is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment by processing information that is contained in visible light.
The machinery that accomplishes these tasks is by far the most powerful and complex of the sensory systems. The retina, which contains 150 million light-sensitive rod and cone cells, is actually an outgrowth of the brain. In the brain itself, neurons devoted to visual processing number in the hundreds of millions and take up about 30% of the cortex, as compared with 8% for touch and just 3% for hearing.
*
Introduction to AI
46

Human Visual Processing
The optic nerves convey signals from the retinas first to two structures called the lateral geniculate bodies, which reside in the thalamus, a part of the brain that functions as a relay station for sensory messages arriving from all parts of the body. From there the signals proceed to a region of the brain at the back of the skull, the primary visual cortex, also known as V1. They then feed into a second processing area, called V2, and branch out to a series of other, higher centers-- dozens, perhaps--with each one carrying out a specialized function, such as detecting color, detail, depth, movement, or shape or recognizing faces.
But how do we make sense out of the visual data?
