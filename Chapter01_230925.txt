Pronunciation: in-'te-l&-j&n(t)s 
Function: noun 
Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French, from Latin intelligentia, from intelligent-,  intelligens intelligent 
• 1 a (1) : the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations : REASON;  also : the skilled use of reason (2) : the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's  environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (as tests) b Christian Science : the basic eternal quality of divine Mind c : mental acuteness : SHREWDNESS 
• 2 a : an intelligent entity; especially : ANGEL b : intelligent minds or mind <cosmic intelligence> • 3 : the act of understanding : COMPREHENSION

What is Artificial Intelligence? 
• Not just studying intelligent systems, but  building them… 
• Psychological approach: an intelligent  system is a model of human intelligence 
• Engineering approach: an intelligent  system solves a sufficiently difficult  problem in a generalizable way
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 5 
A Bit of AI History (section 1.3) 
• Gestation (1943-1955) 
– Early learning theory, first neural network, Turing test 
– McCulloch and Pitts artificial neuron, Hebbian learning  
• Birth (1956) 
– Name coined by McCarthy 
– Workshop at Dartmouth 
• Early enthusiasm, great expectations (1952-1969) 
– GPS, physical symbol system hypothesis 
– Geometry Theorem Prover (Gelertner), Checkers (Samuels) – Lisp (McCarthy), Theorem Proving (McCarthy), Microworlds (Minsky et.  al.) 
– “neat” (McCarthy @ Stanford) vs. “scruffy” (Minsky @ MIT)

What is Artificial Intelligence?  (again) 
• Systems that think like  humans 
– Cognitive Modeling Approach – “The automation of activities  that we associate with human  thinking...” 
– Bellman 1978 
• Systems that act like  humans 
– Turing Test Approach 
– “The art of creating machines  that perform functions that  
require intelligence when  
performed by people” 
– Kurzweil 1990 
• Systems that think  
rationally 
– “Laws of Thought” approach – “The study of mental faculties  through the use of  
computational models” 
– Charniak and McDermott 
• Systems that act rationally – Rational Agent Approach 
– “The branch of CS that is  concerned with the  
automation of intelligent  
behavior” 
– Lugar and Stubblefield

Acting Humanly 
• The Turing Test  
(1950) 
– Can machines think? 
– Can machines behave  
?
intelligently? 
Human 
• Operational test for  intelligent behavior – The Imitation Game

June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 9 
Acting Humanly 
• Turing Test (cont) 
– Predicted that by 2000, a machine might have a 30%  chance of fooling a lay person for 5 minutes 
– Anticipated all major arguments against AI in  following 50 years 
– Suggested major components of AI: knowledge,  reasoning, language understanding, learning 
• Problem! 
– The turning test is not reproducible, constructive, or  amenable to mathematical analysis
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 10 
Thinking Humanly 
• 1960’s cognitive revolution 
• Requires scientific theories of internal activities  of the brain 
– What level of abstraction? “Knowledge” or “Circuits” – How to validate? 
• Predicting and testing behavior of human subjects (top down) 
• Direct identification from neurological data (bottom-up) • Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience – Now distinct from AI
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 11 
Thinking Rationally 
• Normative (or prescriptive) rather than  descriptive 
• Aristotle: What are correct arguments / thought  processes? 
• Logic notation and rules for derivation for  thoughts 
• Problems: 
– Not all intelligent behavior is mediated by logical  deliberation 
– What is the purpose of thinking? What thoughts  should I have?
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 12 
Acting Rationally 
• Rational behavior 
– Doing the right thing 
• What is the “right thing” 
– That which is expected to maximize goal  achievement, given available information 
• We do many (“right”) things without thinking – Thinking should be in the service of rational action

Applied Areas of AI 
• Heuristic Search 
• Computer Vision 
• Adversarial Search (Games) • Fuzzy Logic 
• Natural Language Processing • Knowledge Representation • Planning 
• Learning
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 14 
• Playing chess • Driving on the  highway 
Examples 
• Recognizing speech 
• Diagnosing diseases 
• Translating languages 
• Mowing the lawn • Answering questions 
• Data mining
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 15 
Heuristic Search 
• Very large search space 
– Large databases 
– Image sequences 
– Game playing 
• Algorithms 
– Guaranteed best answer 
– Can be slow – literally years 
• Heuristics 
– “Rules of thumb” 
– Very fast 
– Good answer likely, but not guaranteed!  
• Searching foreign intelligence for terrorist activity.
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 16 
Computer Vision 
• Computationally taxing   
– Millions of bytes of data  
per frame 
– Thirty frames per second 
• Computers are scalar /  
Images are  
multidimensional 
• Image Enhancement vs.  
Image Understanding 
• Can you find the terrorist  
in this picture?
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 17 
Adversarial Search 
• Game theory... 
– Two player, zero sum – checkers, chess, etc. • Minimax 
– My side is MAX 
– Opponent is MIN 
• Alpha-Beta 
– Evaluation function...”how good is board” – Not reliable...play game (look ahead) as deep as  possible and use minimax. 
– Select “best” backed up value. 
• Where will Al-Qaeda strike next?

Example: Tic Tac Toe #1 • Precompiled move  
table. 
• For each input  board, a specific  move (output  
board) 
• Perfect play, but is  it AI?
move  
table 
encode look  up 
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 20 
Example: Tic Tac Toe #2 
• Represent board as a magic square, one integer  per square 
• If 3 of my pieces sum to 15, I win 
• Predefined strategy: 
– 1. Win 
– 2. Block 
– 3. Take center 
– 4. Take corner 
– 5. Take any open square
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 21 
Example: Tic Tac Toe #3 
• Given a board, consider all possible moves (future  boards) and pick the best one 
• Look ahead (opponent’s best move, your best move…)  until end of game 
• Functions needed: 
– Next move generator 
– Board evaluation function 
• Change these 2 functions (only) to play a different  game!
June 01, 2025 AI: Chapter 1: Introduction 22 
Fuzzy Logic 
• Basic logic is binary 
– 0 or 1, true or false, black or white, on or off,  etc... 
• But in the real world there are of “shades” – Light red or dark red 
– 0.64756 
• Membership functions

Natural Language Processing 
• Speech recognition vs. natural language processing – NLP is after the words are recognized 
• Ninety/Ten Rule 
– Can do 90% of the translation with 10% time, but 10% work  takes 90% time 
• Easy for restricted domains 
– Dilation 
– Automatic translation 
– Control your computer 
• Say “Enter” or “one” or “open” 
– Associative calculus 
• Understand by doing
